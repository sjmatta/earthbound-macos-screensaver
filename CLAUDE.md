# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- Xcode (for native `.saver` build via `xcodebuild`)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (`brew install go-task`)

## Build Commands

This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev) for build automation. Primary commands:

```bash
task install      # Build everything and install to ~/Library/Screen Savers
task run          # Install and launch screensaver for testing
task dev          # Start Vite dev server for browser testing
task logs         # Stream live screensaver logs (run in separate terminal)
task check        # Run diagnostics on installation
task clean        # Remove all build artifacts
task rebuild      # Clean + full rebuild + install
task kill-processes  # Clear cached screensaver processes after rebuilding
```

Individual build steps:
```bash
task setup        # Build web assets with Vite (npm install + vite build)
task build        # Build native .saver bundle (runs setup if needed)
```

CI runs on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on push/PR to `main` — builds the native bundle and verifies the output structure.

## Architecture

Two-layer system: JavaScript rendering wrapped in a native macOS screensaver bundle.

**Web Layer** (`src/`):
- `main.js` - Owns the render loop, randomly cycling through 327 layer combinations
- Uses `earthbound-battle-backgrounds` npm package for rendering
- Vite bundles everything into a single `screensaver.js` file (IIFE format)

`main.js` deliberately does **not** call the engine's `Engine.animate()`. It drives
`renderLayers()` itself, for two reasons:
1. `animate()` offers no way to stop — it keeps a module-private `frameID` and there is
   no cancel API, so the loop outlives any attempt to shut it down.
2. `animate()` rewrites the layer alpha array when a layer's `entry` index is falsy.
   Index 0 is a perfectly valid background, so a session that randomly drew layer 0
   would get stuck rendering a single layer at full opacity for its entire lifetime.

Layer opacity is fixed at 0.5/0.5 in `main.js` and never mutated. Keep it that way.

**Native Layer** (`native/EarthboundScreensaver/`):
- `EarthboundScreensaverView.swift` - Main screensaver view, hosts WKWebView, passes settings as URL query params
- `ConfigureSheetController.swift` - Settings UI (cycle interval, show layer names), communicates changes to JS via `webView.evaluateJavaScript`
- Loads bundled HTML/JS via `loadFileURL(_:allowingReadAccessTo:)`

**Native ↔ Web bridge**: Native code passes `?interval=N&showLayerNames=bool` on initial load. Runtime updates call `window.setShowLayerNames(bool)` via `evaluateJavaScript`.

**URL Parameters** (for dev/browser testing):
- `interval` — seconds between background changes (default: 60)
- `showLayerNames` — show/hide layer name indicator (default: true)
- `layer1` / `layer2` — pin specific layer indices (0–326); pinned layers do not cycle
- `debug` — keep the layer indicator on screen permanently

**Layer indicator text**: names come from `src/layerNames.json` when an index is listed
there. That table has to be compiled by hand and is currently empty, so in practice every
layer falls back to a description derived from the ROM — index plus distortion style, e.g.
`#019 Interlaced`. Adding entries to `layerNames.json` overrides the fallback per index.

**Build Output**: `dist/EarthboundScreensaver.saver` - self-contained macOS screensaver bundle

## Critical: macOS Sonoma/Sequoia WKWebView Fix

### The Problem
macOS Sonoma (14.x) and Sequoia (15.x) introduced a breaking change for WKWebView in screensavers. The ScreenSaverEngine's view hierarchy causes WKWebView to think it's "occluded" (hidden), which **pauses all JavaScript execution and CSS animations**. This results in a blank/black screen even though the WebView loads successfully.

### The Solution
Disable window occlusion detection using the private API `_setWindowOcclusionDetectionEnabled:`:

```swift
let selector = NSSelectorFromString("_setWindowOcclusionDetectionEnabled:")
if webView.responds(to: selector) {
    webView.perform(selector, with: false)
}
```

This fix was discovered in the [WebViewScreenSaver project](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver/commit/827156642601ac6ce1fbe2b632e8d6d424bcbbd3).

### Script Tags Must Not Use `type="module"` (file:// CORS Issue)
WKWebView loaded via `loadFileURL` uses `file://` origins. ES module scripts (`<script type="module">`) enforce CORS, which silently fails on `file://` — JavaScript never executes and the screen is blank with no errors in logs. The Vite build config includes a `fileUrlCompatPlugin` that strips `type="module"` and `crossorigin` from the output HTML and uses `format: 'iife'` for the JS bundle. After any Vite upgrade, verify `dist/index.html` has a plain `<script>` tag.

### What Does NOT Work (macOS 15+)
The following private WKPreferences APIs throw `NSUnknownKeyException` and will crash the screensaver:
- `config.preferences.setValue(true, forKey: "allowFileAccessFromFileURLs")`
- `config.preferences.setValue(true, forKey: "allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs")`

These were removed or restricted in recent macOS versions. Do NOT use them.

### What DOES Work
Use `loadFileURL(_:allowingReadAccessTo:)` - this is the official public API for loading local files:
```swift
webView.loadFileURL(htmlURL, allowingReadAccessTo: bundleURL)
```
Pass the bundle's root URL to `allowingReadAccessTo:` to enable access to all resources within the bundle.

## Debugging macOS Screensavers

### Log Commands
```bash
task logs                # Stream live logs
task logs-errors         # Show recent errors only
log show --last 5m --predicate 'processImagePath contains "legacyScreenSaver"'
```

### Key Processes
- `legacyScreenSaver` - Hosts third-party .saver bundles
- `WallpaperAgent` - Manages screensaver/wallpaper lifecycle in Sequoia
- `ScreenSaverEngine` - Main screensaver app

### Screensaver Preferences Location
```bash
plutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.*.plist
```

### macOS Sequoia Notes
- Third-party screensavers appear in "Other" section (click "Show All" to see them)
- WKWebView works but requires the occlusion detection fix above
